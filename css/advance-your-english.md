## Normal flow

Normal flow is how browser lays out HTML pages by default when you do nothing to control page layout.

```markup
<p>I love coding.</p>
<ul>
    <li>python</li>
    <li>rust</rust>
    <li>matlab</li>
</ul>
<p>good!</p>
```

Elements stacked on top of one another--the first paragraph, followed by the unordered list, followed by the second paragraph.

Elements that appear one below the other are described as **block** elements, in contrast to **inline element** , which appear besides one another like the individual words in a paragraph.

{% hint style="info" %}
use it rather than fighting against it.
{% endhint %}
